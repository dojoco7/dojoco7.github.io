	<p>Hello Everyone and welcome to my webpage. I am 37 seven years old, currently living in Spain and 
        even though I can't support my team locally, I will support them everyone I go. My job allows me to travel the world quite often. 
        This year I have decide to show my support for my team by taking my Buccanners flag everywhere I go and let it fly. 
        I belong to a group of diehard fans known as Crue Life. Together we share our love for the Bucs!!</p>

	<p>I am a gamer as well. My list of games I currently play are Call of Duty, Spell Break  and Rocket League.
	I mainly play on Playstaion, but hope one day to build my own computer in the near future.</p>
