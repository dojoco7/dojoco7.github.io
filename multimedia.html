	<h2>Changing the Oil</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>To change the oil, you first want to gather all the tools you will need; oil, drain pan, 9/16 socket and wrench, oil filter and tons of rags.</p>
	<br>
	<p>First you are going to take you socket and wrench and locate the bolt that will drain the oil. Ensure the drain pan is underneath to catch oil.</p>
	<p>Let oil drain completely out! As it is draining, you can switch out the oil filter with the new one. Use your vehicle manual to locate where it is.</p>
	<p>When replacing the filter, use some oil to lubricate the ring before placing it back on. At this point you should be ready to add the new oil now.</p>
	<p>First place the bolt back in so the new oil doesn't drain out. Once you have the bolt in, you can slowly pour the new oil in, being careful not to spill any.</p>
	<p>Finally, clean up any spills and let the vehicle run for five to ten minutes to cycle the new oil through. What I like to do during this is pour the old oil into</p>
	<p>the oil jug, making it easier to take to your local auto shop to depose of.</p>
